# Aqoole Engine

This project is based on https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vulkan-tutorials  (Apache License 2.0)

I have added my original vulkan rendering engine "Aqoole Engine" with Apache License 2.0.

If built successfully, you can see many cubes along with auto forwarding.
You can use gyro operation for camera.
